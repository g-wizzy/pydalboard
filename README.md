# Pydalboard

This is a prototype that is being developed for fun, aiming to create a GUI application that allows for composition of multiple sound effect modules, and hearing the results in real-time.

## Usage

The `main.py` file allows to test the basic functions of the project, currently adding a slight delay onto a `wav` file. This file is not in the repository and must be passed as an argument to the call:

```
python main.py /path/to/my/file.wav
```
